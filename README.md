# Disclaimer 
This application isn’t accurate enough to ban someone for using a spoofer; it just guesses if someone might be using one. If it does give a result about them, it’s often unclear whether or not they are using a spoofer. You should use this as an assistant tool rather than a standalone app for detecting spoofers

# How does it work?
People who use spoofers usually don't have a lot of accounts linked (Xbox, Discord, etc) and their Steam account is usually not that old and this app uses this information to guess who might be using a spoofer

# How does it check Steam account's ages?
By using steamid.pro, if you want to use a Steam web API key or other method you would have to rewrite `utils.js`
